Our group is delighted to announce that we have been awarded an impressive <b>$877,079 </b>GRF research grant to examine metal-organosulfur complexes and their impact on Earth's Chemistry and prebiotic evolution. This project will enhance our understanding of these geochemically important organic materials, their ability to bind Au and Cu, and their potential role in the early stages of chemical evolution and the origin of life. We are proud to share that this marks our eighth successful RGC GRF application in succession here in Hong Kong (and we have been successful in all of them!), demonstrating our continued commitment to advancing scientific knowledge in this emerging and critical field of geochemistry.

This project will make use of a combination of high-resolution ion mass spectrometry (FT-MS) and structure-sensitive infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) spectroscopy to examine the interactions between metal ions and complexes, with a particular focus on gold and copper. The study will experimentally probe how sulfur-bearing ligands such as thiols and mercaptocarboxylates interact and bind to Au and Cu centers, and complement these spectroscopic studies with quantum chemical calculations to assign vibrational frequencies to observed IRMPD bands.

This project will also open up new possibilities to investigate the structure of metal-biomolecule complexes, with an initial focus on single amino acids with amine, carboxylate, and thiol groups bound to gold(III) and Cu(II)-halide complexes. By combining Fourier-transform mass spectrometry (FT-MS) IRMPD spectroscopic studies with DFT calculations, we will be able to shed some light on how these geochemically important Au and Cu complexes attach to biomolecules, and provide  insight into their spectroscopic and thermochemical properties. The study will also explore how such metal-biomolecule association reactions contribute to the mobility of Au and Cu in aqueous ore fluids.

This type of research has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of the molecular-scale association reactions governing the mobility, transformation, and deposition of Au and Cu with organosulfur ligands. Furthermore, it could shed light on the role that these metal-organosulfur complexes played during the emergence of functional biomolecules on early Earth, offering valuable insights into the origins of life and the fundamental processes that shaped our planet's evolution.

<b>Two PhD Positions for 2024 "Metals in Ore Nanodroplets" Oct1, 2023</b> :books: :microscope: :nerd_face: 


We are excited to announce two PhD positions available in the Department of Earth Sciences, University of Hong Kong. These projects aim to study the speciation of metal complexes and biomolecules in aqueous solution and to probe the structure of the water solvation shell around metal clusters using advanced techniques such as FT-mass spectrometry and IR spectroscopy.

In the first project, the focus will be on investigating metal cluster formation in water vapor and examining the water solvation shell structures around these clusters using FT-mass spectrometry and IR spectroscopy. The study includes measuring IRMPD spectra of hydrated metal clusters, utilizing table-top OPO and free-electron laser systems. Using static and dynamic quantum chemical tools, the aim will be to decode the ion core structure and water solvation shell. The project will initially concentrate on  sulfur ligated metal clusters containing Au, Cu, and Ag, using a custom-built OPO laser system and FEL systems with adjustable mid-IR range output.

In the second project, the focus will be on examining the stability of small biomolecule fragments, such as peptides, nucleosides, and nucleotides, in hydrothermal solutions. This research will utilize a recently installed, custom-built hydrothermal spectroscopic cell, developed in partnership with Sietec AG in Zurich (CH). This Au-Ni-coated spectrophotometric cell enables the investigation of biomolecules under hydrothermal conditions, evaluating the kinetic and thermodynamic stability of these substances in environments resembling seafloor black smokers. The pressure capacity of this cell is up to roughly 2 kbar, temperatures up to 400Â°C, and is equipped with sapphire optical view-ports, and compatibility with a fiber-optic spectrophotometer for real-time analysis.

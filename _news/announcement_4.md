<b>New Au-lined high-temperature spectrophotometric cell for origins of life studies, Feb21, 2024 </b> :alembic: :fire:  :microscope: :dna: 

We are happy to announce the successful installation of a state-of-the-art Au-Ni-coated spectrophotometric cell in our laboratory, developed in collaboration with Sietec AG in Zurich (CH). This advanced spectrophotometric cell will enhance our ability to study a wide range biomolecules, such as peptides and nucleosides, at hydrothermal conditions,  focusing on the kinetic and thermodynamic stability of these materials at conditions commonly found around seafloor black smokers.

This spectrophotometric cell features a pressure capacity of up to 2 kbar, temperatures up to 400Â°C, various sapphire optical view-ports and compatibility with a fiber-optic equipped spectrophotometer for real-time analysis. 

For further information or should you be interested in collaborating on this area of work, contact us at kono@hku.hk or visit https://konohl.github.io/ for additional details.

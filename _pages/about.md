<p style="text-align: justify;"> We study ore fluids using a combination of mass spectrometry, IR spectroscopy, and IR lasers that help us to measure the structure and stability of small molecular clusters in liquid water and vapor. Our setup consists of a modified Bruker ICR FT mass spectrometer, a OPO/OPA laser system with tunable mid-IR radiation, and a custom-built hydrothermal cell linked to a UV-vis spectrophotometer. We also employ static and ab initio MD calculations to analyze molecular cluster structures and properties.</p>

As an instructor I teach courses in aqueous geochemistry `(EASC2401), (EASC2406)`, the science underpinning WMD system and the implications on proliferation and terrorism`(CCGL9033)`, and the origins of life `(CCST9018)`.
